## VIVA QUESTIONS :

- Bitmap Image , raster image , pixel image => all are same
- Normall they are png and jpeg images
- Normal eye can see upto 40m
- If two lines are 0.1m apart they can be clearly seen distinctly by normal eye

### Color Models:
CMYK => CYA MAGENTA YELLOW BLACK => model adapted by printers
HSL => Hue , saturation , lightness 
CIE LAB => when we click on more color, the hexagonal color we get is CieLAb
RGB => For human eye


### Image Formats: 
Why we use PNG format for photographic images ?
- png images for logo / printing them , as they have loss-less compression , ideally they dont compresed ,so found in original forma.

Why we use jpeg for photos?
-As jpeg is lossy compression  without hampering quality compression of image carried out.
- jpeg : compressive , Png: non-compressive

Why we use GIF format ?
- As they are hgihly compressable image, used in web-development. Ised for tranferring the data over internet.

Why we use tiff format?
- It stands for Tag Image File Format, is a computer file used to store raster graphics and image information. 
used by photographers, They are a highest-quality images, used before editing if you want to avoid lossy file formats ,
used for graph generation & manuscript image generation. (high quality - large Size)
- They dont distort beyond expansion of 100%
- we use xbit to create tiff images 

Why we use Vector Images?
- They are used over the net & for communication , Slow image generation , image created by mathematical formulation & information.
- Vectors have a resolution which means how many pixels it has in one unit .It doesn't depend upon screen size or DPI(dots per Inch).
- it is image generation technique ( here information of intensities send and then image generated)
- ( In rasters : all information sent and image generated in one go)
- CHATGPT(ANS) A vector image is a type of image format that represents graphics as mathematical equations rather than a collection of pixels. Unlike raster images (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP), which are made up of a grid of individual pixels, vector images use paths defined by mathematical expressions like lines, curves, and shapes.



- Human eye only perceive RGB, bt printers/other device can perceive many others
- decreasing intensity decreases no .of colors shown , false contouring

## ORDER OF COLOR IN PIXEL
1) RGB
2) CMYK

- 24 bit Mode (8 bit per R/G/B) is the nearest to Natural Colors







***Chat GPT:***
Certainly! Let's discuss various types of image formats commonly used in digital image processing. Image formats are essentially ways to represent and store visual information in a file. Different formats have different characteristics, compression methods, and applications. Here are some of the most common image formats:

1. **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):**
   - **Compression:** Lossy compression.
   - **Color Depth:** 24-bit (16 million colors).
   - **Usage:** Ideal for photographs and images with gradients.
   - **Advantages:** Good compression with minimal loss of quality.

2. **PNG (Portable Network Graphics):**
   - **Compression:** Lossless compression.
   - **Color Depth:** 24-bit (16 million colors) or 48-bit (true color).
   - **Usage:** Suitable for images with transparency and sharp edges.
   - **Advantages:** Lossless compression, supports transparency.

3. **GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):**
   - **Compression:** Lossless compression.
   - **Color Depth:** 8-bit (256 colors).
   - **Usage:** Often used for simple graphics, icons, and animations.
   - **Advantages:** Supports animations and transparency, small file sizes.

4. **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format):**
   - **Compression:** Can be both lossless and lossy.
   - **Color Depth:** 1-bit (black and white) to 48-bit (true color).
   - **Usage:** Commonly used in professional printing and publishing.
   - **Advantages:** Supports high-quality images, suitable for archival.

5. **BMP (Bitmap):**
   - **Compression:** Usually uncompressed (lossless).
   - **Color Depth:** 1-bit (monochrome) to 24-bit (true color).
   - **Usage:** Commonly used in Windows environments.
   - **Advantages:** Simple and widely supported, but larger file sizes.

6. **RAW:**
   - **Compression:** Generally uncompressed.
   - **Color Depth:** 12-bit or 14-bit (higher bit depth than other formats).
   - **Usage:** Used by professional photographers for storing unprocessed image data.
   - **Advantages:** Retains maximum image quality, allows extensive post-processing.

7. **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):**
   - **Compression:** XML-based (text-based, not pixel-based).
   - **Color Depth:** Resolution-independent, can be specified by the display device.
   - **Usage:** Vector graphics suitable for logos, icons, and scalable images.
   - **Advantages:** Scalable without loss of quality, supports interactivity.
